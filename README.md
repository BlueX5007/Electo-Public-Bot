# Electo-Public-Bot
The basic but working bot which you can fork and make as your own bot (Credits are given in some of the commands)

You are **not** allowed to say or announce that this is you coded/made it. Instead, you can either stay quiet, or give us credits. The same way, you **cannot** just fork this and take the credits off the commands, you can do this **but** you are required to give us credits in a common command such as a help command.

***Info***

Made using Py-Cord Alpha
May cause **Unknown Interaction 404** on buttons or slash commands, but that's discord's issues, and will be fixed by discord.

***Requirements***

Must have all intents enabled
Bot must not be blacklisted or banned
Must install these packages

pip install humanfriendly
pip install datetime
pip install git+https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord
